          <h3>Resistor Calculator App</h3>
          <!-- <img src="path/to/resistor-calculator-image.jpg" alt="Resistor Calculator App"> -->
          <p>This app quickly calculates the resistance of colour-coded resistors, supporting various types (3 to 6 bands). Developed using Kotlin and Android Studio, it includes a customisable UI for easy input and allows users to switch between different resistor types. The app can be expanded to support SMD resistors and further refined with additional settings.</p>

          <!-- <img src="path/to/geography-game-image.jpg" alt="GeoLearnr - Geography Game App"> -->
          <p>GeoLearnr is an educational app that teaches geography through a quiz-based game. Inspired by GeoGuessr, it challenges users to identify locations based on visual and geographical clues. The app features user statistics, multiple difficulty settings, and tracks performance over time. The game content is loaded from a JSON file and uses real-time population data via an API.</p>

          <img src="project images/capacitive sensor.jpg" alt="Capacitive Liquid Level Sensor" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <p>This project focused on designing a capacitive liquid level sensor to measure liquid levels without contact. The sensor was built externally on a container and calibrated for temperature variations and different liquids. Simulations optimised electrode placement for maximum sensitivity, and real-world testing achieved 5% accuracy. Further improvements explored include shielding from external interference and enhancing sensor design for different liquid types.</p>

          <!-- <img src="path/to/fpga-tanks-game-image.jpg" alt="Tank Game on FPGA"> -->
          <p>Inspired by the classic Nintendo game Tanks, this project implemented a two-player tank game on an FPGA using VHDL. The game was displayed via VGA and controlled with external buttons, featuring player and CPU tanks that could shoot, move in eight directions, and collide with walls. The project utilised modular design for tanks, bullets, and collision detection, while VGA management handled the game display.</p>

          <h3>CNC Driver</h3>
          <!-- <img src="path/to/cnc-driver-image.jpg" alt="CNC Driver"> -->
          <p>This project involved designing a CNC driver using a Raspberry Pi Pico to control stepper motors. The hardware included a custom power supply and motor control circuits, while the software was written in C to parse G-Code commands and control the motor movement. Key challenges included managing voltage references for motor controllers and refining the PCB layout for improved heat dissipation.</p>
